**Commands for running locally on mac that I used**
**Have to be in the same directory as the docker compose file**

docker-compose build  

docker-compose up -d

docker ps -a //list all running containers

docker-compose run web python3  manage.py migrate



**Also have to create databse users manually meaning the postgres user from env file**

Command to access postgres database: 

$docker-compose exec postgres psql -U unicorn_user postgres


CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres' CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN;

//create a postgres role


CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] postgres

//create database

//see all users in and databases
\du

//exit database console
/q


**Access running site on**

http://localhost/catalog/
